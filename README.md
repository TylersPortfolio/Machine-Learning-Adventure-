# Machine-Learning-Adventure-
My Journey into machine learning and Artifical Intelligence!

This is inteded to be a personal adventure while recording accomplishments through projects.
This is also for business and academic motivation.
I am a beginner in this particular field of study.
Taking the beginning steps to create my own basic AI to use for basic everyday internet needs.

Thank you for taking the time read and look at my code. If you want to continue to help me grow you are more than welcome to help.

Furthermore the repisortory is going to set up as small individual lessons and projects that I complete throughout years of learning.
